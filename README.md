GDM_CLASS: an implementation of the Generalized Dark Matter model inside the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System
====================================================================================================================

Original CLASS authors: Julien Lesgourgues and Thomas Tram
with several major inputs from other people, especially Benjamin
Audren, Simon Prunet, Jesus Torrado, Miguel Zumalacarregui, Francesco
Montanari, etc.

GDM implementation authors: St√©phane Ilic, Michael Kopp, Daniel B. Thomas


Compiling GDM_CLASS and getting started
---------------------------------------

The process of compiling and running GDM_CLASS is strictly identical to the original CLASS code. Please refer to the CLASS code webpage (http://class-code.net/) and GitHub repository (https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) for detailed instructions.

To check that the code runs, type:

    ./class explanatory.ini

The explanatory.ini file is THE reference input file, containing and
explaining the use of all possible input parameters. We recommend to
read it, to keep it unchanged (for future reference), and to create
for your own purposes some shorter input files, containing only the
input lines which are useful for you. Input files must have a *.ini
extension.

If you want to play with the precision/speed of the code, you can use
one of the provided precision files (e.g. cl_permille.pre) or modify
one of them, and run with two input files, for instance:

    ./class test.ini cl_permille.pre

The files *.pre are suppposed to specify the precision parameters for
which you don't want to keep default values. If you find it more
convenient, you can pass these precision parameter values in your *.ini
file instead of an additional *.pre file.

The automatically-generated documentation is located in

    doc/manual/html/index.html
    doc/manual/CLASS_manual.pdf

On top of that, if you wish to modify the code, you will find lots of
comments directly in the files.

Python wrapper
--------------

To use CLASS from python, or ipython notebooks, or from the Monte
Python parameter extraction code, you need to compile not only the
code, but also its python wrapper. This can be done by typing just
'make' instead of 'make class' (or for speeding up: 'make -j'). More
details on the wrapper and its compilation are found on the wiki page

https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki

Plotting utility
----------------

Since version 2.3, the package includes an improved plotting script
called CPU.py (Class Plotting Utility), written by Benjamin Audren and
Jesus Torrado. It can plot the Cl's, the P(k) or any other CLASS
output, for one or several models, as well as their ratio or percentage
difference. The syntax and list of available options is obtained by
typing 'pyhton CPU.py -h'. There is a similar script for MATLAB,
written by Thomas Tram. To use it, once in MATLAB, type 'help
plot_CLASS_output.m'

Developing the code
--------------------

If you want to develop the code, we suggest that you download it from
the github webpage

https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public

rather than from class-code.net. Then you will enjoy all the feature
of git repositories. You can even develop your own branch and get it
merged to the public distribution. For related instructions, check

https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki/Public-Contributing

Using the code
--------------

While CLASS is free to use, authors request that publications using their code should cite at least the paper `CLASS II: Approximation schemes <http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933>`. Additionally, we request similarly
